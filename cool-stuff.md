### [SpookyBooky](https://spookybooky.com/)

justin tates provides brief reviews mostly of pulp novels from the 60s, but with a depth of research and knowledge that's fascinating. two of my favorite reviews are of [Gay Circus (1970)](https://spookybooky.com/2021/01/15/kym-allyson-gay-circus-1970/), a gay clown fetish tract; and [Women Work, Men Weep (1942)](https://spookybooky.com/2023/09/17/belle-bruck-women-work-men-weep-1942/) a "nauseating cringe-fest" of male chauvinist sexual anixety.

one of my favorite details in tate's reviews are his attempts to peel back nom-de-plumes and careers, especially when he fails. 

### [Exist Yesterday](https://www.jonathanbogart.net/blog/)
i found jonathan bogart's work when i was hunting down anything i could find on [Rodrigo Munoz Ballester's _Manuel_](https://www.jonathanbogart.net/blog/2019/1/17/1985-rodrigo). ballester's illustrations are breaktaking, intricate, emotive and _hairy_. the existence of the high-res scans on bogart's blog and more on tumblr and the publisher's site tease me to the existence of an ebook or a scan _somewhere_ online but i've made no progress in the english-speaking internet. i set an abebooks watch for if a copy ever goes on sale. 

bogart hasn't posted since his [2022 top 50 international pop songs](https://www.jonathanbogart.net/blog/2022/3/7/50-songs-2022), a jet-setting list of latin and african pop music that's insightful and fun. his 2021 list is where i encountered Tokischa's banger [Tukuntazo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8jyhfaoly8)
